# Xojo-BME280-I2C

Xojo driver module for Bosch Sensortec BME280 temperature, barometer and humidity sensor.

It makes use of WiringPi GPIO Interface library for the Raspberry Pi, which details are availble from [here](http://wiringpi.com).

I have been developing with Xojo 2018r2 on Mac and testing on Raspberry Pi 3B+ hardware with latest Raspbian OS.
